                <p>Ans: 1.parent component pass on name and onChange handler to its child , which child can access through its props
                    <br />
                    2.In child select field contains an handler, as you select different name, this.handlechange is called, which call the changeName function of parent by calling this.props.onChange. <br /> 3.changeName method in parent set the state to different name which was selected in child select field. <br /> 4.then change state is again passed to child automatically,as prop to child </p>

                <h2>Ques-3: how useState works ? </h2>
                <p>ANs: first of All useState enables you to add state to function components. Calling React.useState inside a function component generates a single piece of state associated with that component. <br />Whereas the state in a class is always an object, with Hooks, the state can be any type.Each piece of state holds a single value, which can be an object, an array, a boolean, or any other type you can imagine. <br /> So when should you use the useState Hook?Itâ€™s especially useful for local component state, but larger projects might require additional state management solutions. </p>
